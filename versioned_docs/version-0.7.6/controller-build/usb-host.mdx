# USB Host Port Installation

:::info

The steps you will need to complete will be based on what RP2040 board you are using and they may differ immensely. Some boards will require you to solder additional wires and connect peripheral boards onto your board. Others will have the host port already installed and no additional hardware steps will be required.

:::

At the minimum, the following requirements are true for all RP2040 boards.

- 2 GPIO pins that are sequential (i.e. `GPIO Pin X` and `GPIO Pin X+1`) and **NOT** in series/parallel with any capacitors or large, non-termination resistors
- A 5V pin (i.e. `VBUS`, `VCC`, `+5V`, etc.)
- A ground pin (i.e. `GND`)

You may need the following additional hardware to complete the installation. What you will need specifically will depend on your specific board configuration.

- Solder and Soldering Iron
- Wires to connect to the USB A port
- Wire terminators to connect to your GP2040-CE Board
- A USB Host board breakout board or an extra USB Cable
