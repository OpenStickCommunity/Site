# Versioning

Versioning is used so that the documentation for features currently in development can be updated without affecting user documentation for the current released version, which should remain fairly static and generally only updated with a new release version.

The result is a default version copy for the current release that is served to the user when visiting https://gp2040-ce.info and another "Next" version that reflects unfinished documentation for the next release.

## On New Release

When a new release is ready, tag the document version with a name that matches the release number (i.e. #.#.#). Once that has been completed, commit the changes and make a pull request to update the site documentation.

### Tag New Version

```shell
cd docs/
npm run docusaurus docs:version #.#.#
```

When tagging a new version, the document versioning mechanism will:

- Copy the full docs/ folder contents into a new versioned_docs/version-\{versionName\}/ folder.
- Create a versioned sidebars file based from your current sidebar configuration (if it exists) - saved as versioned_sidebars/version-\{versionName\}-sidebars.json.
- Append the new version to versions.json.

### Delete Prior Version

At the root of the GP2040-CE folder, run the following command to delete the version

```shell
rm -rf versioned_docs/version-#.#.#
rm -rf versioned_sidebars/version-#.#.#-sidebars.json
```

Then remove the version from versions.json.

Example:

```diff
[
  "0.7.7",
- "0.7.6"
]
```

## Updating Documentation

### Update Future Release Documentation

Updates can be made directly in the `docs/` folder or `sidebars.js` as these changes are not reflected in the default versioned documents users will see on the site. Any changes to the `docs/` folder or `sidebars.js` are made to the `Next` version.

### Update Current Release Documentation

This process is different from updating documentation for future releases as changes need to be made with the versioned documents. Changes to the current release version of documentation will need to be made to the files in `/versioned_docs/version-X.X.X` and `/versioned_sidebars/version-X.X.X-sidebars.json`.

These changes will be reflected in the default user facing documentation that appears when users go to https://gp2040-ce.info and do not specifically select the `Next` version of documentation.
