# Getting Help/Support

## Discord

If you need help with something, the best place to get quick support may be our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/k2pxhke7q8). 

Please note that we do not offer support for commercial products that have been purchased from most sellers.  In these cases please reach out to the seller for help and support first.

Once you've read the [pinned post](https://discord.com/channels/1049366310389289001/1132450634243772519), create a post in the [support channel](https://discord.com/channels/1049366310389289001/1132447732662018089) with the following information.

1 - Are you a vendor?
2 - What device are you using?
3 - Where did you buy it? (post link to sales page)
4 - Have you reached out to the vendor with this support question already? (please give a summary of the conversation)
5 - What version and distribution of the firmware are you currently running? (check this via web-config)
6 - What is the problem that you are having?
7 - What trouble shooting steps have you already done?

Please also include a picture of the front and back of the device in question along with at least one image of the controller board if the device is a full stick or has a case.  Please also include images of your web-config pages if required.

Any support posts that do not have this information filled out and pictures included will not be answered.

## Github Issues

You can open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE/issues/new/choose).
