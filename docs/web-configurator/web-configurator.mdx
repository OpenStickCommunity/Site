# GP2040-CE Web Configurator

Select the button labels to be displayed in the usage guide:

<InputLabelSelector />
<br />

GP2040-CE contains a built-in web-based configuration application which can be started by holding <Hotkey buttons={["S2"]}/> when plugging your controller into a PC or by holding <Hotkey buttons={["S2", "B3", "B4"]}/> for five seconds while the controller is plugged in. Then access [http://192.168.7.1](http://192.168.7.1) in a web browser to begin configuration.

### Supported

- Windows
- Mac
- Linux
- SteamOS
- iPadOS

### Not fully supported

- Android
- iOS

:::note

Not all Android and iOS devices are supported for web-config. In our testing some Android devices will work and others will not. Most USB-C based iOS devices will work. We do not keep a list of which devices do and do not work.

## Trouble accessing web-config on a Windows PC

If your Windows PC cannot access the built-in web-config of your GP2040-CE controller, try the following steps:

1 - **Ensure you are in web-config mode**

- Ensure your controller is in Web-Config mode.
- Verify the USB cable is securely connected and supports data transfer (some cables are power-only).

2 - **Try a Different Browser**

- Some browsers may block local device access. Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
- Disable browser extensions (like ad-blockers) temporarily.

3 - **Check the URL**

- The web-config URL is http://192.168.7.1.

4 - **Disable Firewall/Antivirus Temporarily**

- Security software may block communication. Test with protections temporarily disabled.

5 - **Try Another USB Port/PC**

- Test on a different port or on a different computer.

6 - **Try restarting your computer**

- Try restarting your computer.

:::warning

In addition to the above there may be issues with drivers installed on your PC. Due to the risk of causing system issues the GP2040-CE team will not assist in driver based issues or recommend drivers be installed / uninstalled.

:::note

Linux distributions may need some extra steps to access the web configurator; see [Linux Setup](#linux-setup).

## Linux Setup

When you plug in your controller while holding <Hotkey buttons={["S2"]}/>, you should see it connect in the kernel logs if you run `dmesg`:

```sh
[   72.291060] usb 1-3: new full-speed USB device number 12 using xhci_hcd
[   72.450166] usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=cafe, idProduct=4028, bcdDevice= 1.01
[   72.450172] usb 1-3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[   72.450174] usb 1-3: Product: TinyUSB Device
[   72.450176] usb 1-3: Manufacturer: TinyUSB
[   72.450177] usb 1-3: SerialNumber: 123456
[   72.484285] rndis_host 1-3:1.0 usb0: register 'rndis_host' at usb-0000:06:00.1-3, RNDIS device, 02:02:84:6a:96:00
[   72.498630] rndis_host 1-3:1.0 enp6s0f1u3: renamed from usb0
```

In the above example, **enp6s0f1u3** is the virtual Ethernet interface for your controller. If you don't see the first `rndis_host` line, make sure `CONFIG_USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST` is compiled in your kernel or as a module.

The web configurator is automatically running, you just need to be able to reach it. Some configurations automatically set up the route, so try [http://192.168.7.1](http://192.168.7.1) in your browser now. If it doesn't load, try configuring an IP for the interface manually via: `sudo ifconfig enp6s0f1u3 192.168.7.2`.

Whether or not you had to add an IP manually, you should end up with a route something like this:

```sh
% ip route
default via 10.0.5.1 dev enp5s0 proto dhcp src 10.0.5.38 metric 2
10.0.5.0/24 dev enp5s0 proto dhcp scope link src 10.0.5.38 metric 2
192.168.7.0/24 dev enp6s0f1u3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.7.2     <---
```

Then the configurator should be reachable in your browser.
