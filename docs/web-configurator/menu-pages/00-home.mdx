Here you can see the system stats for your device.

**Version**
Device Name - This will tell you the name of the device as well as the name of the UF2 that was placed onto the unit.
Current - The current version of the firmware that is running on the device
Latest - The latest available version of the firmware in our release section

**Memory**
This section shows various stats about your flash memory module.

::note

GP2040-CE requires a device with a minimum of 2mb flash (as is standard for the Raspberry Pi Pico).

There have been a small number of reports of very low cost clone devices from places like AliExpress that only come with 1mb of flash.  These should be avoided as they will not work as intended.

If you are making your own device please ensure that you use at least a 2mb flash module.
