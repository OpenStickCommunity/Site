:::note

GP2040-CE requires a device with a minimum of 2mb flash (as is standard for the Raspberry Pi Pico).

There have been a small number of reports of very low cost clone devices from places like AliExpress that only come with 1mb of flash.

Devices with only 1mb of flash should be avoided as they may not work or may not work as intended.

If you are making your own device please ensure that you use at least a 2mb flash module.
