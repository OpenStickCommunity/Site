## Input Mode Settings

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Input Mode Settings](../../assets/images/gpc-settings-input-mode.png)

- `Current Input Mode` - Choose the main input mode (XINPUT, DINPUT, Switch, PS4, HID-Keyboard, etc.) this connected device will boot into when powered on. This selection will persist through unplug and plugging back in the controller.

### Keyboard Mapping

Here you can remap the GP2040-CE buttons to different keyboard keycodes that will be sent to the PC or game console when pressed in Keyboard Mode.

### Additional PS4 Settings

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Additional PS4 Settings](../../assets/images/gpc-settings-ps4.png)

- `Switch Touchpad and Share` - Share will now be mapped to A2 rather than S1, Touchpad will be now mapped to S1 rather than A2
- `Authentication Settings`
  - `Uploaded Key File` - Upload key files obtained from a Dualshock 4 to authenticate and bypass the PS4's 8-minute time out
  - `Host USB` - Use a dongle, converter, or licensed PS4 controller to authenticate your GP2040-CE device

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Additional PS4 Settings](../../assets/images/gpc-settings-ps4-upload-key-files.png)

- `Uploaded Key File`
  - `Private Key (PEM)` - Choose your PEM file.
  - `Serial Number (16 Bytes in Hex Ascii)` - Choose your serial number file.

:::danger Warning

The GP2040-CE project will not provide any files or information related to acquiring these keys and files under any circumstances.

Do not ask via any of communication channels (e.g. social media, direct messages, Github Issues, GP2040-CE Discord) as this will result in a permanent blacklist/ban.

### Experimental USB Hub Support

GP2040-CE now has experimental support for USB hubs.  A USB hub will now let you connect multiple authentication dongles as well as a keyboard.

There are no settings to change for USB hub support, it is simply plug and play.  

As an example, you could have the following connected to a USB hub:<br />
1 - USB keyboard<br />
2 - Mayflash MagicBoots PS4 v1.1 dongle<br />
3 - Mayflash MagicBoots Xbox 1 dongle<br />
4 - Mayflash MagicBoots Xbox 360 dongle<br />

So long as the USB hub is compatible this combination should let switch between PS5 / Xbox / Xbox360 mode without physically switching the dongles around.

This will also, for the first time, allow you to use a keyboard in PS5 / Xbox / Xbox360 mode (without authentication issues so long as an appropriate dongle is used).

:::caution

USB Hub Support is currently experimental.  We do not recommend that it be used for commercial applications.

We do not guarantee that any combination of devices and hubs will work and we will not accept support tickets or GitHub issues about combinations that do not work at this time.

We have seen issues with some USB hubs.  We do not guarantee that any single hub will or will not work and we have no plans to introduce a list of known good hubs.

We have also seen issues with some dongles when added to a USB hub setup like the Mayflash Magic-X.  When the Mayflash Magic-X is added to a USB hub it may not work as intended and also may cause other dongles not to work as intended. 

We leave it to the user to explore various combinations and see what works and does not work for them.

Please be mindful of power draw if you are adding multiple dongles and a USB hub to devices and setups that use LEDs.  If you are finding issues with your setup try turning off LEDs.

## Gamepad Settings

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Gamepad Settings](../../assets/images/gpc-settings-gamepad.png)

- `D-Pad Mode` - Choose the default D-Pad mode (D-Pad, Left Stick or Right Stick).
- `SOCD Cleaning Mode` - Choose the default SOCD Cleaning Mode (Neutral, Last Win, First Win, OFF). Please note that PS4, PS3 and Nintendo Switch modes do not support setting SOCD to off and will default to Neutral SOCD.
- `Forced Setup Mode` - Allows you to lock out Input Mode, the ability to enter Web-Config or both. Enabling a web-config lockout will require you to nuke and reload the firmware if you wish to make further changes.
- `4-Way Joystick Mode` - Enables 4-Way Joystick mode which will prevent non-cardinal directions from registering. When a second cardinal direction input is received, the gamepad direction will change to the newest cardinal direction, similar to [SOCD Last Win](../../hotkeys.mdx#socd-last-win).
- `Profile Number` - Enables different GPIO pin mappings per profile. Changeable through the Web-Config or [hotkeys](../../hotkeys.mdx#load-profile-1-4).
- `Debounce Delay in milliseconds` - Timeframe where the firmware will ignore additional inputs to prevent switch noise from accidentally triggering unintended inputs.

## Boot Input Modes

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Boot Input Modes](../../assets/images/gpc-settings-boot-input-modes.png)

For each of the buttons listed in the menu, you can assign a different input mode to enter while holding that button during boot (e.g. when plugging in the controller or immediately after resetting the controller).

For the list of input modes to select from, see [Input Modes](../../usage.mdx#input-modes).

## Hotkey Settings

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Boot Input Modes](../../assets/images/gpc-settings-hotkey.png)

An arbitrary number of buttons and directions, plus the optional Function (Fn) button, can be used to define desired hotkey actions. Select `Fn` if desired, plus one or more buttons/directions, and associate them with a hotkey action. The default hotkeys can be modified or removed, and new ones added, up to 12 in total.

The available hotkey actions will expand over time. We may also expand the number of hotkeys available to configure in the future. For a list of the available hotkey actions, see [Hotkeys](../../hotkeys.mdx).
