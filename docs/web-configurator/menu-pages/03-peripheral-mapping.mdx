# Peripheral Mapping

![GP2040-CE Configurator - Peripheral Mapping](../../assets/images/gpc-peripheral-mapping.png)

Here you can assign the GPIO pins necessary for using peripherals and add-ons that require I2C and a USB host port. These include, but are not limited to

- [OLED Display](./07-display-configuration.mdx)
- [I2C Analog ADS1219](../../add-ons/i2c-analog-ads1219.mdx)
- [PS Passthrough Add-on](../../add-ons/ps-passthrough.mdx)
- [Xbox One Passthrough Add-on](../../add-ons/xbox-one-passthrough.mdx)
- [Keyboard Host Add-on](../../add-ons/keyboard-host.mdx)

## I2C

Each I2C block, `I2C0` and `I2C1`, has separate settings and each must be configured before using the respective I2C block. These must be configured properly before any feature or add-on that uses I2C can be used.

- `Toggle` - This will toggle a specific I2C block on and off
- `SDA` - The GPIO pin used for Serial Data (SDA).
- `SCL` - The GPIO pin used for Serial clock (SCL).
- `Speed` - Sets the speed of I2C communication.
  - `Normal - 100000`
  - `Fast - 400000`
  - `Fast Plus - 800000`

The SDA and SCL pins must match a pair found on the table below for each I2C block. If this is not configured correctly, your I2C devices will not function properly.

## SPI

Each SPI block, SPI0 and SPI1, has separate settings and must be configured before using the respective SPI block. These must be configured properly before any feature or add-on that uses SPI can be used.

- `Toggle` - This will toggle a specific SPI block on and off
- `RX` - The GPIO pin used for MISO, to receive data.
- `CS` - The GPIO pin used for Chip Select (CS).
- `SCK` - The GPIO pin used for Serial Clock (SCK).
- `TX` - The GPIO pin used for MOSI, to send data.

The pins must match a set found on the table below for each SPI block. If this is not configured correctly, your SPI devices will not function properly.

## USB Host

- `Toggle` - This will toggle the USB Host Port on and off
- `D+` - The GPIO Pin used to carry Data Plus between the USB Host Port and RP2040
- `Enable 5V` - The GPIO Pin used to enable 5V power to the host port on the board.
- `Pin Order` - This setting is based on the order that the Data pins are connected to sequential GPIO pins
  - `D+/D-` - The GPIO pins are set such that, sequentially, `D+` is immediately followed by `D-`
  - `D-/D+` -The GPIO pins are set such that, sequentially, `D-` is immediately followed by `D+`

:::note Enable 5V

This is only applicable to a small number of boards (e.g. Adafruit RP2040 Feather USB Host) as they possess pins for enabling and disabling 5V port on the USB host port. Most boards do not require this to be set.
