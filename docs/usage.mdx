# GP2040-CE Usage

Select the button labels to be displayed in the usage guide:

<InputLabelSelector />
<br />

:::caution

The v0.5+ release has some breaking changes to boards other than the Raspberry Pi Pico. If you are using such a board, do not update from an older version unless you have a backup .uf2 from a known good version, or you know what you're doing.

:::

## Buttons

GP2040-CE uses generic button labeling for gamepad state, which is then converted to the appropriate input type before sending. This table provides a map of GP2040-CE buttons to the supported input types and layouts:

<Tabs groupID="input-modes">

<TabItem value="Primary Input Modes" label="Primary Input Modes" default>

<InputTable />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mini/Classic Consoles" label="Mini/Classic Consoles">

<InputTableMiniClassic />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

If your controller is missing dedicated buttons for any specific inputs, check the [Hotkeys page](./hotkeys.mdx) on how to map a button combination that will emulate those missing inputs.

:::note

Unlike other controllers, Keyboard gets different keys for directional buttons. You can change the key mappings for Keyboard mode in [Webconfig mode > Configuration > Keyboard Mapping](./web-configurator/menu-pages/04-keyboard-mapping.mdx)

:::

| Direction | Keyboard    |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Up        | Up Arrow    |
| Down      | Down Arrow  |
| Left      | Left Arrow  |
| Right     | Right Arrow |

## Bootsel Mode

Bootsel Mode is the state of the board where firmware can be flashed onto the board. You will need to use this whenever there is an update or as part of the troubleshooting process.

You can boot into Bootsel Mode by either holding <Hotkey buttons={["S1", "S2", "Up"]}/> buttons while plugging in the controller, by booting into the Web Configurator and then restarting in Bootsel Mode, or by holding <Hotkey buttons={["S1", "B3", "B4"]}/> together for five seconds while the controller is plugged in. There is no way to leave Bootsel mode once activated other than by flashing new firmware or by unplugging the device.

Generally, there is a Bootsel button somewhere on the board. This is often an exposed button on the PCB or a button inside the controller that requires either a pin to press or disassembly of the controller.

:::note

There are a number of controllers that elect not to include the Bootsel button. In these instances, you will need to locate the placement of the button and use conductor to connect the 2 sides of the contacts or pads together while plugging in or booting the controller.

:::

## WebConfig Mode

WebConfig Mode is the state of the board where built-in web browser-based configuration application is launched. From here, you can customize and configure your controller as needed. For more information, click [here](./web-configurator/web-configurator.mdx) for more information.

You can boot into WebConfig Mode by holding the <Hotkey buttons={["S2"]}/> button while plugging in the controller or by holding <Hotkey buttons={["S2", "B3", "B4"]}/> for five seconds while the controller is plugged in. Holding this same combination again for five seconds while in webconfig mode will swap the device back to the previously used controller mode.

## Input Modes

GP2040-CE is compatible with a number of systems and input modes. The specific input modes assigned to 8 buttons when held is configurable in the [Web Configurator](./web-configurator/menu-pages/01-settings.mdx#boot-input-modes).

However, there are default input modes assigned in precompiled firmware. To change input modes, **hold one of the following buttons as the controller is plugged in:**

| Primary Input Mode |        Button Held         |
| :----------------- | :------------------------: |
| Nintendo Switch    | <Hotkey buttons={["B1"]}/> |
| XInput             | <Hotkey buttons={["B2"]}/> |
| PS3/DirectInput    | <Hotkey buttons={["B3"]}/> |
| PS4                | <Hotkey buttons={["B4"]}/> |
| Xbox One           | <Hotkey buttons={["R1"]}/> |
| Keyboard           | <Hotkey buttons={["R2"]}/> |
| Original XBox      |        `Unassigned`        |

| Mini/Classic Consoles        | Button Held  |
| :--------------------------- | :----------: |
| Sega Genesis/MegaDrive Mini  | `Unassigned` |
| NEOGEO mini                  | `Unassigned` |
| PC Engine/Turbografx 16 Mini | `Unassigned` |
| EGRET II Mini                | `Unassigned` |
| ASTROCITY Mini               | `Unassigned` |
| Playstation Classic          | `Unassigned` |

:::note

Input mode is saved across power cycles.

## Hotkeys

A number of useful hotkeys exist that change the functionality of GP2040 without needing to access the Web Configurator. Commonly used hotkeys include changing the directions to emulate a digital DPad, Left analog joystick, Right analog joystick or to change [Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Direction (SOCD)](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=SOCD) cleaning modes. Different SOCD cleaning modes will ensure the controller obeys certain directional input rules when sending inputs to the computer or game console.

A number of hotkeys are enabled by default and if you are encountering issues with unexpected behavior on your controller, verify that you did not accidentally trigger a hotkey.

| Hotkeys Enabled By Default                         | Inputs                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| [Home Button](hotkeys.mdx#home-button)             | <Hotkey buttons={["S1","S2","Up"]}/>    |
| [Dpad Digital](hotkeys.mdx#dpad-digital)           | <Hotkey buttons={["S1","S2","Down"]}/>  |
| [Dpad Left Analog](hotkeys.mdx#dpad-left-analog)   | <Hotkey buttons={["S1","S2","Left"]}/>  |
| [Dpad Right Analog](hotkeys.mdx#dpad-right-analog) | <Hotkey buttons={["S1","S2","Right"]}/> |
| [SOCD Up Priority](hotkeys.mdx#socd-up-priority)   | <Hotkey buttons={["S2","A1","Up"]}/>    |
| [SOCD Neutral](hotkeys.mdx#socd-neutral)           | <Hotkey buttons={["S2","A1","Down"]}/>  |
| [SOCD Last Wins](hotkeys.mdx#socd-last-win)        | <Hotkey buttons={["S2","A1","Left"]}/>  |

:::note

Selected D-Pad mode and SOCD cleaning mode are saved across power cycles.

## Add-Ons and Additional Features

There are a number of add-ons that expand the functionality of GP2040-CE, such as [analog joystick emulation](./add-ons/analog.mdx) and [turbo functions](./add-ons/turbo.mdx). Due to the large number of add-ons created by the community, they are located in a separate documentation page. Navigate to Add-Ons page for more information on the individual add-ons.
