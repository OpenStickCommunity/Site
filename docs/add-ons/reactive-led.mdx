LED X
`LED GPIO Pin` - The GPIO pin that the LED is connected to.
`Action` - Choose which action will trigger this LED.
`Default Mode` - Choose the behaviour when this action is not enabled.
`Active Mode` - Choose the behaviour when this action is enabled.

## Hardware

You will require an LED connected to the GPIO pin and ground.
