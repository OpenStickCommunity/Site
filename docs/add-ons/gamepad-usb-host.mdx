# FGamepad USB Host Configuration

Purpose: This add-on is intended to allowgamepads to be used inline with GP2040-CE.  As example of this would be plugging a supported USB controller into an available USB host port and then playing on the USB controller.  This can be used to convery a supported controller to work on a system it was not intended to work on.
